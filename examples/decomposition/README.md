# Decomposition Example Bank

Status: active  
Stage: Stage 2 — `/decompose`  
Purpose: few-shot guidance + calibration for Controlled Visual Role Decomposition  
Minimum examples: 5  
Current examples: 12  

---

## Why this exists

Stage 2 is intentionally limited. It converts a screenshot, reference image, wireframe, or section description into a role-based visual inventory. It must not recommend an Elementor architecture, score architecture options, produce an Elementor tree, or choose implementation details.

This bank gives the model reusable examples for how to decompose common web-section patterns. The examples are synthetic, pattern-based, and grounded in common UI/component patterns rather than copied from a specific third-party design.

## Research basis

Use these examples together with the Stage 2 rules:

- Elementor Structure/Navigator logic: a section should be understandable as a structured tree before implementation decisions.
- Elementor Container/Flexbox logic: visual groups should be identified before choosing layout mechanisms.
- Atomic Design: UI can be decomposed into smaller elements, repeated component-like groups, and larger section organisms.
- UI grouping research: text, widgets, images, and visual fragments often function as semantic groups, not isolated atoms.
- Accessibility practice: meaningful images/logos/content must be distinguished from decorative visuals and unknown alt requirements.

## How to use these examples

The model must copy the method, not the content.

For a new section:

1. Observe visible groups.
2. Classify by visual/content role.
3. Identify repeated component candidates.
4. Identify the visual core.
5. Separate decoration from meaningful content.
6. Mark overlay/connector candidates without choosing implementation.
7. Identify responsive risks.
8. Mark unknowns instead of inventing facts.
9. List implementation assumptions that are not allowed yet.

## Non-negotiable rule

Examples must never be used to jump directly to `/architectures` or `/recommend`.

They exist only to improve `/decompose` quality.
