# Stage 10 — /handoff-export

Status: confirmed_hardened_v1.0.0
Version: 1.0.0
Payload schema: ev4-handoff-export-payload@1.0.0
Anchor required: yes
Debug trace compatible: yes
Source policy: Stage Source Access Matrix applies
Production release gate: one realistic E2E pipeline run is still required before release-level confirmation

## Purpose

`/handoff-export` packages a completed and audited EV4 pipeline run into a compact, copy-ready handoff for a human Elementor builder, reviewer, or implementation agent.

It preserves the approved architecture, selected build tree, implementation instructions, audit outcome, blocker/flag state, unresolved confirmations, debug trace references, and repair anchors without adding new decisions.

## Non-Purpose

Stage 10 is not a design, architecture, scoring, implementation, repair, research, or final-audit stage.

Stage 10 must not:

- create, select, or modify an architecture candidate;
- rewrite the Stage 7 build tree;
- modify Stage 8 implementation instructions;
- downgrade or hide Stage 9 findings;
- resolve unknowns or confirmations without named evidence;
- add Elementor widgets, classes, variables, CSS, animations, breakpoints, dynamic data, plugins, Pro dependencies, SVG, or assets;
- invent exact settings not present in the approved payloads;
- claim release-ready status when E2E evidence is missing;
- transform a failed audit into a pass by summarizing it more softly.

## Core Rule

```text
Package only the audited record. Do not redesign, repair, re-score, or reinterpret.
```

Stage 10 is a packaging and continuity stage. Its job is to make the result usable while keeping every audit flag, unknown, confirmation, and blocker visible.

## Required Input Gate

Stage 10 must stop with `handoff_blocked_missing_input` if any required input is missing, schema-incompatible, or contradictory.

Required inputs:

```yaml
required_inputs:
  stage_anchor:
    schema: ev4-stage-anchor@1.1.0
    source_stage: /final-audit
    target_stage: /handoff-export
    required_fields:
      - target_stage_hardening_status
      - confidence_delta
      - critical_unknowns
      - blocking_items
      - gate_results
      - audit_flags
      - required_user_confirmations
      - repair_routes
      - partial_rerun_state
      - allowed_work
      - forbidden_work
      - stop_conditions
  final_audit_payload:
    schema: ev4-final-audit-payload@1.0.0
    required_fields:
      - input_authorization
      - source_payload_ledger
      - audit_summary
      - architecture_preservation_audit
      - build_tree_preservation_audit
      - elementor_native_dependency_audit
      - editability_audit
      - position_layering_audit
      - responsive_audit
      - accessibility_audit
      - performance_dom_audit
      - design_system_audit
      - scoped_css_audit
      - asset_media_audit
      - dynamic_data_interaction_audit
      - unknown_confirmation_survival_audit
      - severity_register
      - blockers_and_repair_routes
      - final_audit_status
      - stage_9_self_audit
      - debug_trace_ref_or_payload
      - next_stage_anchor_or_repair_anchor
  implementation_payload:
    schema: ev4-implementation-payload@1.0.0
    required_when: final audit status allows handoff
  build_tree_payload:
    required_when: final handoff includes builder-facing tree
  recommendation_payload:
    required_when: final handoff includes selected architecture summary
  debug_trace:
    schema: ev4-debug-trace@1.0.0
    required_when: debug mode active or final audit references a trace
  e2e_state:
    e2e_run_available: yes | no
    required_for_release_ready_claim: yes
```

Input authorization fails when:

- Stage Anchor is missing, outdated, not `ev4-stage-anchor@1.1.0`, or not targeted to `/handoff-export`;
- `Final_Audit_Payload` is missing, partial, or older than `ev4-final-audit-payload@1.0.0` without an explicit compatibility note;
- Stage 9 emitted `REPAIR ANCHOR` instead of `NEXT STAGE ANCHOR — /handoff-export`;
- `final_audit_status` is absent or not one of the allowed Stage 9 statuses;
- blocker or high findings are present without a visible repair route;
- the handoff attempts to omit unresolved medium findings, confirmations, unknowns, or E2E release blockers;
- approved implementation payload, tree payload, or recommendation payload cannot be referenced when builder handoff is requested;
- debug trace is referenced but not included or linked;
- any payload identity changes across Stage 6/7/8/9.

If input authorization fails, Stage 10 must emit a `REPAIR ANCHOR` or `HANDOFF BLOCKED REPORT` and must not emit a final builder handoff.

## Stage Source Access Matrix Binding

Stage 10 may use only:

```text
Final_Audit_Payload
Implementation_Payload
Build_Tree_Payload
Recommendation_Payload
Score_Audit_Payload only as referenced by final audit
Stage Anchor v1.1
EV4_DEBUG_TRACE blocks or trace references
active project contracts
verified export/runtime evidence if included in Final_Audit_Payload
user-provided final delivery preference, if supplied
```

Stage 10 must not use:

```text
new visual assumptions
new architecture candidates
new scoring evidence
new recommendation logic
new implementation choices
new RAG claims
TUYA concepts as new decision evidence
unverified external tutorials
```

Source classification is mandatory for handoff claims:

```yaml
handoff_source_ref:
  source_id:
  source_type: final_audit_payload | implementation_payload | build_tree_payload | recommendation_payload | score_audit_payload | stage_anchor | debug_trace | project_contract | export_evidence | user_input
  claim_carried:
  fact_class: project_specific_behavior | implementation_observation | project_default | platform_capability | project_conceptual_model | unresolved_unknown | audit_finding
  allowed_use: summarize | quote | checklist_item | blocker_notice | repair_instruction | next_action
  limitation:
```

## Authoritative Source Order

When sources conflict, Stage 10 must use this order:

1. active Stage Anchor blockers, stop conditions, required confirmations, and repair routes;
2. Stage 9 `Final_Audit_Payload`;
3. Stage 9 `REPAIR ANCHOR`, if present;
4. Stage 8 `Implementation_Payload`;
5. Stage 7 `Build_Tree_Payload`;
6. Stage 6 `Recommendation_Payload`;
7. debug traces and payload references;
8. active project contracts and source-access rules;
9. user-provided final delivery formatting preference.

Conflict rules:

- If Stage 9 fails or emits a repair anchor, Stage 10 outputs a blocked handoff, not a builder handoff.
- If Stage 8 conflicts with Stage 9, Stage 9 wins for handoff status and repair routing.
- If Stage 7/8 details are missing but Stage 9 passes with minor flags, Stage 10 must include a `needs_reference` item rather than inventing the missing detail.
- If E2E is absent, Stage 10 may package a contract-level or run-level handoff but must not claim release-ready status for the prompt pack.

## Handoff Eligibility Matrix

```yaml
handoff_eligibility:

    builder_handoff_allowed: conditional
    contract_release_ready_claim_allowed: no
    e2e_blocker_notice_required: yes
```

```

Rules:

- `release_ready_claim_allowed: yes` only when the run passed and the repository has a realistic E2E run confirming the full pipeline.
- If E2E is absent, write `release_ready_claim_allowed: no` even if the current handoff is otherwise builder-ready.

### 2. SOURCE / PAYLOAD LEDGER

```yaml
source_payload_ledger:
  - payload_name:
    schema:
    source_stage:
    status: present | missing | partial | incompatible | referenced_only

    forbidden_shortcut:
    qa_check:
```

Rules:

- If exact settings are unavailable, write `exact_setting_available: no` and provide a bounded instruction, not an invented value.

    alt_text_policy:
    file_requirements:
    replacement_safe: yes | no | unknown
    accessibility_risk:
    source_ref:
```

Rules:

- Meaningful images need alt policy.
- Decorative assets may use empty alt only when classification is supported.
- Missing asset sources must remain visible.

### 9. RESPONSIVE CHECKLIST

```yaml
responsive_checklist:
  breakpoint_source:
  breakpoint_values_available: yes | no | partial | unknown
  checks:
    - target_node_id:
      desktop_instruction:
      tablet_instruction:
      mobile_instruction:
      reading_order_preserved:
      collision_risk:
      meaningful_content_hidden:
      final_audit_flag_ref:
```

Rules:

- Do not invent breakpoint values.
- Missing mobile evidence must stay visible as a risk or QA item.
- Any meaningful-content collision risk must carry severity and owner from final audit.

### 10. DYNAMIC DATA / INTERACTION CHECKLIST

```yaml
dynamic_data_interaction_checklist:
  - target_node_id:
    dynamic_source:
    interaction_type:
    authorization_source:
    dependency_status:
    fallback:
    qa_check:
```

Rules:

- No dynamic source, form behavior, loop, carousel, popup, Pro feature, or plugin may be introduced at handoff time.
- If Stage 8/9 did not authorize dynamic behavior, mark `none`.

### 11. AUDIT FLAGS TO PRESERVE

```yaml
audit_flags_to_preserve:
  - finding_id:
    severity:
    status:
    owner_stage:
    handoff_note:
    required_action:
```

Rules:

- Medium findings must be visible in `pass_with_minor_flags`.
- Low/info findings may be summarized but must not contradict final audit.

### 12. UNRESOLVED UNKNOWNS AND USER CONFIRMATIONS

```yaml
unresolved_unknowns_and_confirmations:
  unknowns:
    - unknown_id:
      description:
      introduced_at_stage:
      effect_if_unresolved:
      handoff_instruction:
  required_user_confirmations:
    - confirmation_id:
      question:
      required_before:
      default_safe_behavior:
```

Rules:

- Do not remove an unknown because the handoff would look cleaner.
- Do not turn a required confirmation into a recommendation.

### 13. BUILDER QA CHECKLIST

```yaml
builder_qa_checklist:
  - qa_id:
    check:
    method:
    pass_condition:
    fail_route:
```

Required QA categories:

- Structure Panel tree matches approved Stage 7 tree.
- Meaningful content remains editable.
- Responsive desktop/tablet/mobile review completed.
- Scoped CSS has no global leakage.
- Assets and alt policies match audit.
- No unauthorized dependency appeared during build.
- Final audit flags remain visible.

### 14. DEBUG TRACE REFERENCES

```yaml
debug_trace_references:
  - trace_id:
    schema:
    stage:
    referenced_for:
    availability: embedded | linked | missing
```

If a trace is required but missing, block handoff.

### 15. HANDOFF_PAYLOAD

The machine-readable payload must be emitted after the human-readable handoff.

```json
{
  "schema": "ev4-handoff-export-payload@1.0.0",
  "stage": "/handoff-export",
  "stage_version": "1.0.0",
  "handoff_status": null,
  "release_ready_claim_allowed": false,
  "input_authorization": {
    "stage_anchor_schema": "ev4-stage-anchor@1.1.0",
    "final_audit_payload_schema": "ev4-final-audit-payload@1.0.0",
    "implementation_payload_schema": "ev4-implementation-payload@1.0.0",
    "missing_inputs": [],
    "blocked": false
  },
  "source_payload_ledger": [],
  "approved_architecture_summary": null,
  "structure_panel_tree": null,
  "elementor_build_checklist": [],
  "class_variable_component_checklist": [],
  "scoped_css_checklist": [],
  "asset_media_accessibility_checklist": [],
  "responsive_checklist": [],
  "dynamic_data_interaction_checklist": [],
  "audit_flags_to_preserve": [],
  "unresolved_unknowns_and_confirmations": {
    "unknowns": [],
    "required_user_confirmations": []
  },
  "builder_qa_checklist": [],
  "repair_routes": [],
  "debug_trace_references": [],
  "e2e_release_blocker": {
    "e2e_run_available": false,
    "release_confirmation_blocked": true,
    "note": "One realistic E2E pipeline run is required before repository release-level confirmation."
  },
  "closure_or_next_anchor": null
}
```

## Blocked Handoff Payload

When handoff is blocked, emit this reduced payload instead of the full builder payload:

```json
{
  "schema": "ev4-handoff-export-payload@1.0.0",
  "stage": "/handoff-export",
  "stage_version": "1.0.0",
  "handoff_status": "blocked_requires_repair",
  "input_authorization": {
    "blocked": true,
    "missing_inputs": [],
    "incompatible_inputs": [],
    "blocking_findings": []
  },
  "blocked_reason": null,
  "visible_blockers_and_high_findings": [],
  "repair_routes": [],
  "safe_partial_rerun_plan": null,
  "repair_anchor": null,
  "debug_trace_references": []
}
```

## Safe Partial Rerun Plan for Blocked Handoff

When Stage 10 is blocked, include a local repair plan that respects the Partial Rerun Contract:

```yaml
safe_partial_rerun_plan:
  changed_or_failed_input:
  impact_class:
  earliest_safe_start_stage:
  stages_to_reuse:
  stages_to_invalidate:
  required_anchor:
  required_payloads:
  user_confirmation_required: yes | no
  reason:
```

Default repair ownership:

| Failure | Earliest safe start stage |
|---|---|
| Missing/invalid Final_Audit_Payload | `/final-audit` |
| Missing/invalid Implementation_Payload | `/implementation` |
| Missing/invalid Build_Tree_Payload | `/build-tree` |
| Missing/invalid Recommendation_Payload | `/recommend` |
| Final audit blocker owned by implementation | `/implementation` |
| Final audit blocker owned by build tree | `/build-tree` |
| Final audit blocker owned by recommendation | `/recommend` |
| Missing E2E evidence for release-level confirmation | `/intake` for test setup, then full E2E test run |
| Stage 10 packaging omission only | `/handoff-export` local repair |

## Repair Anchor Template

Use when handoff is blocked.

```text
REPAIR ANCHOR — [repair target]
anchor_schema: ev4-stage-anchor@1.1.0
source_stage: /handoff-export
repair_target_stage: [/recommend | /build-tree | /implementation | /final-audit | /handoff-export]
failure_type:
failure_evidence:
minimal_repair_instruction:
forbidden_shortcut:
required_payloads:
invalidated_downstream:
expected_return_anchor:
```

Rules:

- The repair target must be the earliest stage that owns the failed information.
- Do not route every failure to `/handoff-export` just because the failure was observed there.
- Do not allow handoff text to become a substitute for repairing upstream payloads.

## Final Closure Note

Use only when the handoff passed and no repair anchor is needed.

```text
FINAL CLOSURE NOTE — /handoff-export
anchor_schema: ev4-stage-anchor@1.1.0
source_stage: /handoff-export
target_stage: none
handoff_payload_schema: ev4-handoff-export-payload@1.0.0
handoff_status: ready_for_builder_handoff | ready_with_minor_flags
release_ready_claim_allowed: yes | no
critical_unknowns_preserved:
remaining_audit_flags:
required_user_confirmations:
e2e_release_blocker:
debug_trace_refs:
partial_rerun_state:
  reusable_until:
  invalidation_triggers:
  earliest_safe_rerun_stage:
```

## Strict Critic Checklist

Before emitting Stage 10 output, run this self-check:

```yaml
stage_10_self_audit:
  - check: valid Stage Anchor v1.1 from /final-audit is present
    result: pass | fail
  - check: Final_Audit_Payload schema is present and compatible
    result: pass | fail
  - check: final audit status controls handoff eligibility
    result: pass | fail
  - check: blocker/high findings are not hidden or softened
    result: pass | fail
  - check: medium findings remain visible in pass_with_minor_flags
    result: pass | fail | n/a
  - check: unresolved unknowns and confirmations are preserved
    result: pass | fail
  - check: builder handoff contains no new architecture or implementation decision
    result: pass | fail
  - check: exact settings are not invented when unavailable
    result: pass | fail
  - check: scoped CSS and responsive risks are carried from final audit
    result: pass | fail
  - check: debug trace references are embedded or linked when required
    result: pass | fail
  - check: E2E release blocker remains visible unless E2E evidence exists
    result: pass | fail
  - check: HANDOFF_PAYLOAD schema is emitted
    result: pass | fail
  - check: closure note or repair anchor is emitted
    result: pass | fail
```

If any required check fails, Stage 10 must emit Format B and route repair to the owning stage.

## Regression Cases

Use these cases to test Stage 10 behavior.

### Handoff Regression 001 — `failed-audit-softened`

Input: Stage 9 status is `fail_requires_implementation_repair`, but Stage 10 produces a friendly final build checklist.

Expected: fail. Stage 10 must output `HANDOFF BLOCKED REPORT` and a repair anchor to `/implementation`.

### Handoff Regression 002 — `medium-flag-disappears`

Input: Stage 9 status is `pass_with_minor_flags` with one medium responsive risk.

Expected: pass only if the medium finding is visible in `AUDIT FLAGS TO PRESERVE`, `RESPONSIVE CHECKLIST`, and `HANDOFF_PAYLOAD`.

### Handoff Regression 003 — `new-css-in-handoff`

Input: Stage 10 adds a new CSS selector not present in Stage 8/9.

Expected: fail. Stage 10 must not introduce implementation details.

### Handoff Regression 004 — `release-ready-without-e2e`

Input: Stage 9 contract is hardened, but no realistic E2E run exists.

Expected: handoff may be packageable only for contract/run usage; repository release-ready claim remains blocked.

### Handoff Regression 005 — `unknown-cleanup`

Input: Stage 9 carries unknown mobile behavior.

Expected: the unknown must remain visible in handoff and payload. It cannot be rewritten as “verify if needed” without severity/effect.

### Handoff Regression 006 — `payload-ledger-missing`

Input: handoff text is complete but payload ledger omits Build_Tree_Payload or Implementation_Payload.

Expected: fail or partial blocked output, depending on whether builder handoff depends on the missing payload.

## EV4_DEBUG_TRACE Addendum

When debug mode is active, Stage 10 must emit:

```json
{
  "schema": "ev4-debug-trace@1.0.0",
  "stage": "/handoff-export",
  "stage_version": "1.0.0",
  "input_digest": {
    "inputs_received": [],
    "inputs_missing": [],
    "input_payload_schemas": []
  },
  "decision_log": [
    {
      "decision_id": "D10-001",
      "decision": "handoff eligibility selected",
      "target": "FINAL BUILDER HANDOFF or HANDOFF BLOCKED REPORT",
      "basis": {
        "evidence_ids": [],
        "rule_ids": ["stage_10_input_gate", "handoff_eligibility_matrix"],
        "unknown_ids": []
      },
      "confidence": "confirmed | blocked",
      "downstream_effect": "allows final packaging or routes repair"
    }
  ],
  "evidence_map": [],
  "unknown_register": [],
  "rule_application_log": [],
  "failure_symptom_index": [],
  "repair_route": null,
  "handoff_payload_schema": "ev4-handoff-export-payload@1.0.0"
}
```

Debug trace must not expose hidden chain-of-thought. It must expose only the auditable input, rule, evidence, unknown, and repair record.

## Pass Criteria

Stage 10 contract hardening is confirmed only if the stage defines:

- input gate;
- source access policy;
- forbidden work;
- authoritative source order;
- handoff eligibility matrix;
- final builder handoff format;
- blocked handoff format;
- payload ledger;
- builder-facing tree/checklist templates;
- audit flag preservation rules;
- unresolved unknown and confirmation preservation rules;
- scoped CSS, responsive, accessibility, asset, dynamic data, and QA handoff checks;
- machine-readable `Handoff_Payload` schema;
- safe partial rerun plan and repair anchor;
- strict self-audit;
- debug trace addendum;
- release-ready/E2E boundary.

## Important Limitation

```text
Stage 10 hardening confirms the handoff-export prompt contract. It does not mean a real EV4 run has been packaged, and it does not remove the E2E release blocker.
```

A repository release-ready claim still requires at least one realistic E2E pipeline run using the hardened contracts.
