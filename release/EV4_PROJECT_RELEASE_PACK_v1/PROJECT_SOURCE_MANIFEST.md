## UX Add-on Files

```text
release/EV4_PROJECT_RELEASE_PACK_v1/EV4_RUN_COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
release/EV4_PROJECT_RELEASE_PACK_v1/EV4_FINAL_OUTPUT_UX_PATCH.md
```

Purpose:

```text
EV4_RUN_COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md:
- Companion reviewer for stage outputs.
- Checks whether the latest stage obeyed EV4 contracts.
- Gives the user the exact next prompt.

EV4_FINAL_OUTPUT_UX_PATCH.md:
- Adds PIPELINE RESULT SNAPSHOT to final /handoff-export.
- Adds a simple teacher-style Persian explanation for the user.
- Preserves all flags, unknowns, and production-readiness boundaries.
```

## Case Memory Add-on File

```text
release/EV4_PROJECT_RELEASE_PACK_v1/EV4_CASE_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md
```

Purpose:

```text
Adds optional post-build learning after /handoff-export.
Turns Elementor build feedback into audited case memory.
Defines validation levels.
Blocks case memory from being used by /decompose to invent visual facts.
```

---

## Builder Companion Feed Add-on File

```text
release/EV4_PROJECT_RELEASE_PACK_v1/EV4_BUILDER_COMPANION_FEED_PROTOCOL.md
```

Purpose:

```text
Creates a copy-ready feed package for a separate interactive builder chat/model after /handoff-export.
Defines required builder-facing outputs such as Class Creation & Application Map, Structure Panel Naming Checklist, Builder Step-by-Step Checklist, Widget Mapping Table, Editable Content Map, Asset Replacement Map, Scoped CSS Need Map, and Responsive QA Checklist.
Preserves the audited handoff as source of truth and blocks redesign, new scoring, hidden assumptions, and production-readiness claims.
```

## File-limit note

If the ChatGPT Project file limit is reached, prefer uploading active add-ons over optional files.

Suggested replacement order:

```text
1. Remove README.md first if needed.
2. Remove PROJECT_SOURCE_MANIFEST.md second if needed.
3. Keep the five core release files.
4. Add EV4_RUN_COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md if you want a companion review chat.
5. Add EV4_FINAL_OUTPUT_UX_PATCH.md if you want clearer final outputs.
6. Add EV4_CASE_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md if you want post-build learning.
7. Add EV4_BUILDER_COMPANION_FEED_PROTOCOL.md if you want interactive step-by-step builder execution in another chat/model.
```

## Notes

The release pack is intentionally smaller than the repository. The repository is the source of truth; this folder is the operational bundle for ChatGPT Project usage.
