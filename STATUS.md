## Scaffolded / Draft Work Remaining

- `references/ELEMENTOR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_RAG_STRATEGY.md` remains `draft_active_v0.3.0` and is now the next highest-priority unfinished contract because `/research` depends on it as active policy input.
- E2E-001 used a realistic textual mockup, not a raster screenshot.
- Pixel-accurate screenshot interpretation remains unvalidated by E2E-001.
- Real Elementor export JSON / EDIS validation remains future work.
- Live Elementor/browser rendering remains future work.

## Research Contract Result

```yaml
RESEARCH_CONTRACT:
  file: stages/02_RESEARCH.md
  status: confirmed_hardened_v1.0.0
  stage_version: 1.0.0
  payload_schema: ev4-research-payload@1.0.0
  confirmed_capabilities:
    - input gate
    - source access policy
    - source pinning
    - retrieved fact ledger
    - unknown and unsupported claim register
    - conflict register
    - downstream source permission map
    - repair routes
    - regression cases
    - self-audit
    - EV4 debug trace addendum
    - NEXT STAGE ANCHOR to /decompose
```

Strict boundary:

```text
/research may prove or disprove platform capability.
/research must not decide what the current screenshot visually contains.
/research must not score, recommend, build, implement, or audit the section.
```

Critical downstream rule:

```text
/decompose may receive the Research_Payload as context, but it must not use RAG, TUYA, official docs, or research facts to invent visual groups, meaningful/decorative classification, or hidden screenshot content.
```

## E2E-001 Result

```yaml
E2E_TEST_REPORT:
  schema: ev4-e2e-test-report@1.0.0
  test_id: E2E-001
  fixture: experiments/E2E-001-smart-home-connector-fixture.md
  fixture_type: realistic_mockup_description
  e2e_status: pass_with_minor_flags
  stages_completed:
    - /intake
    - /decompose
    - /architectures
    - /score-evidence
    - /score-audit
    - /recommend
    - /build-tree
    - /implementation
    - /final-audit
    - /handoff-export
  first_failure_stage: null
  release_blocker_removed: yes
  release_blocker_scope: prompt-pack full-pipeline E2E contract
  source_access_violations: []
  blocker_findings: []
  high_findings: []
  medium_findings:
    - E2E001-MED-001: textual fixture cannot validate pixel-accurate screenshot interpretation or exact visual matching
  low_findings:
    - E2E001-LOW-001: exact token values remain unknown
    - E2E001-LOW-002: exact icon source/library remains unknown
    - E2E001-LOW-003: animation requirement remains unknown
    - E2E001-LOW-004: dynamic dashboard data requirement remains unknown
```

E2E-001 selected architecture during the authorized `/recommend` stage:

```yaml
selected_candidate_id: A02_native_plus_scoped_decorative_css
selected_candidate_family: native editable structure + section-scoped decorative CSS
reason: highest audited eligible score, editable meaningful content, contained decorative connector/glow layer, no third-party dependency, no flattened dashboard content
```

Release boundary interpretation:

```text
The previous release blocker requiring one passing E2E test is removed for the prompt-pack full-pipeline contract because E2E-001 reached /handoff-export, preserved anchors/payloads/unknowns/flags, and left no blocker/high finding.

This does not claim pixel-accurate screenshot interpretation, live Elementor rendering, or real export JSON validation. Those remain future validation tracks.
```

## Stage Anchor v1.1 Notes

A Stage Anchor is required before starting each stage after `/intake`.

Required v1.1 fields include:

- `target_stage_hardening_status`
- `confidence_delta`
- `partial_rerun_state`

Purpose:

- preserve critical unknowns;
- preserve blockers and gate results;
- record whether confidence increased, decreased, stayed unchanged, or was resolved;
- prevent running scaffolded/draft stages as production output without explicit approval;
- preserve invalidation triggers for partial reruns;
- prevent long-context drift;
- keep handoffs compact and auditable.

The anchor is an external structured handoff, not hidden reasoning.

---

## Partial Rerun Notes

If only one input changes, the assistant must not automatically rerun the full pipeline.

It must first produce a `PARTIAL RERUN PLAN` that identifies:

- changed input;
- earliest safe rerun stage;
- reusable stages;
- invalidated downstream stages;
- required payloads;
- required confirmation if the rerun depends on a missing decision.

---

## Knowledge Base / RAG Notes

A structured Elementor knowledge base may support `/research`, `/architectures`, `/build-tree`, `/implementation`, and `/final-audit`.

It must not replace the pipeline or skip `/decompose`, `/score-evidence`, `/score-audit`, or `/recommend`.

Core distinction:

```text
platform capability ≠ project-specific behavior
```

Official documentation can prove Elementor can do something; it cannot by itself prove that the current section should use that thing.

Future export evidence / EDIS may strengthen implementation grounding and final audit checks but must still pass through the pipeline.

### Stage Source Access Matrix

The RAG Strategy defines which sources each stage may use.

Key gates:

- Stage 2 `/research` retrieves and pins sources; it does not interpret the screenshot.
- Stage 3 `/decompose` uses only image/user-provided evidence and must not use RAG to invent visual groups.
- Stage 4 `/architectures` may use TUYA concepts and official docs to verify architecture feasibility.
- Stage 5 `/score-evidence` must score from Rubric + Stage 3/4 evidence; TUYA/RAG cannot boost scores by themselves.
- Stage 7 `/recommend` must recommend only from audited Stage 5/6 outputs; no new RAG preference signals.
- Stage 8/9 may use TUYA + official docs to map approved architecture/tree decisions to structure and implementation.
- Stage 10 may use Stage 9, Stage 8, Stage 7, Stage 6, Stage 5 constraints, TUYA audit concepts, official docs, and export evidence only to audit preservation and capability claims; it must not generate new architecture or implementation.
- Stage 11 may use final audited outputs, debug traces, anchors, and payloads only to package the run; it must not change decisions.
- E2E validation must check source-access compliance across every stage, especially `/decompose`, `/score-evidence`, `/recommend`, `/final-audit`, and `/handoff-export`.

---

## TUYA Internal Concept Reference Notes

The TUYA workbook is treated as an internal conceptual reference, not as official Elementor documentation.

Use `knowledge/TUYA_ELEMENTOR_V4_CONCEPTS.md` to preserve:

- Global Thinking Order: `Context → Structure → Flow/Display → Size/Units → Position/Layering → Responsive → Design System → DOM/Audit`;
- the `confirmed | provisional | unknown` thinking labels;
- normal-flow content plus relative visual stage discipline;
- responsive inheritance caution;
- design-system class/variable/component logic;
- performance and DOM/audit mindset.

Any TUYA-derived fact must be classified as:

```text
source_type: internal_concept_reference
fact_class: project_conceptual_model
```

It may guide reasoning but must not prove platform capability or bypass the EV4 pipeline.

### TUYA Evidence Transition Rule

```text
provisional + stronger supporting evidence → supported / partially supported
provisional + still incomplete evidence → stays provisional
provisional + direct conflicting evidence → CONTRADICTED_EVIDENCE
unknown by itself ≠ contradiction
```

## Stage 8 — /implementation Hardening Notes

Stage 8 is confirmed as a hardened contract, not a scaffold.

Important limitation:

```text
Stage 8 hardening confirms the prompt contract. It does not replace a real pipeline run.
```

---

## Stage 9 — /final-audit Hardening Notes

Stage 9 is confirmed as a hardened contract, not a scaffold.

Important limitation:

```text
Stage 9 hardening confirms the final-audit prompt contract. It does not mean every future real implementation has passed final audit.
```

---

## Stage 10 — /handoff-export Hardening Notes

Stage 10 is confirmed as a hardened contract, not a scaffold.

Important limitation:

```text
Stage 10 hardening confirms the handoff-export prompt contract. It does not mean a future real EV4 run can skip final audit or E2E validation.
```

---

## E2E Test Notes

E2E-001 passed with minor flags.

Validated:

- full stage sequence through `/handoff-export`;
- Stage Source Access Matrix discipline;
- Stage Anchor v1.1 continuity;
- Debug Trace compatibility;
- unknown propagation;
- Stage 4 arithmetic / N/A / unknown handling;
- Stage 5 audit behavior;
- Stage 6 recommendation gate;
- Stage 7 editability and tree readability;
- Stage 8 exact-value restraint and scoped CSS map;
- Stage 9 blocker/high behavior;
- Stage 10 audit-flag preservation.

Not validated by E2E-001:

- pixel-accurate raster screenshot interpretation;
- live Elementor rendering;
- real Elementor export JSON;
- browser/device QA.

---

## Current Next Step

Preferred next action:

```text
Harden references/ELEMENTOR_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_RAG_STRATEGY.md from draft_active_v0.3.0 to active_v1.0.0.
```

The next run should align the RAG strategy with `stages/02_RESEARCH.md` by adding or tightening:

- versioned source-access policy;
- `/research` as the source-pinning stage;
- downstream permission matrix using the current pipeline numbering;
- official source freshness rules;
- export evidence / EDIS boundaries;
- conflict lifecycle;
- forbidden leakage probes;
- pass criteria for active contract status;
- repair routes;
- debug trace and Stage Anchor handoff references.
