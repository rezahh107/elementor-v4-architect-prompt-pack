| /architectures | confirmed_hardened_v1.1.0 | Coverage matrix, unknown propagation, recommendation ban, dynamic guardrails |
| /score-evidence | confirmed_hardened_v1.3.0_patch | Uses rubric 1.3 and Stage 4 v1.3 hardening patch |
| /score-audit | confirmed_hardened_v1.2.0_patch | Adds Stage 5 self-audit, hidden recommendation guard, tie handoff, responsive cap reference binding |
| /scoring-calibration-bank | active | examples/scoring calibration cases added |
| /recommend | confirmed_hardened_v1.1.0_patch | Adds recommendation basis matrix, provenance ledger, strict tie handling, build-tree readiness gate, and debug record |
| /stage-anchor-contract | active | contracts/STAGE_ANCHOR_CONTRACT.md added; all future stages must start from an anchor |

## Stage Anchor Notes

A Stage Anchor is now required before starting each stage after `/intake`.

Purpose:

- preserve critical unknowns;
- preserve blockers and gate results;
- prevent long-context drift;
- keep handoffs compact and auditable;
- avoid reliance on conversational memory alone.

The anchor is not hidden chain-of-thought. It is an external structured handoff.

## Stage 5 v1.2 Notes

Stage 5 now has these additional constraints before Stage 6:

- It must audit its own audit report for hidden recommendation leakage.
- It must keep candidate reporting neutral and avoid implied preference.
- It must emit a tie handoff payload instead of breaking ties.
- It must bind responsive inheritance audits to the authoritative Stage 4/rubric rule.
- It must emit `ev4-score-audit-payload@1.2.0` when the v1.2 patch is active.

## Stage 6 v1.1 Notes

Stage 6 is the first stage allowed to recommend an architecture, but v1.1 makes the recommendation process stricter.

It may run only after Stage 5 returns `pass` or `pass_with_minor_flags`.

It must:

- select only from audit-eligible candidates;
- never override failed gates or Stage 5 findings;
- emit a neutral Recommendation Basis Matrix before selection;
- use a Recommendation Provenance Ledger for every recommendation reason;
- run strict tie handling when Stage 5 emits `selection_ambiguity_flag` or candidates are close;
- avoid subjective or hidden-ranking language outside allowed recommendation sections;
- carry forward unresolved flags and required confirmations;
- block `/build-tree` when confirmations, blockers, or unresolved decision requirements remain;
- emit `ev4-recommend-payload@1.1.0`;
- emit `ev4-recommend-debug-record@1.0.0`.

## Stage 7 v1.0 Notes

Stage 7 is now the structural bridge between `/recommend` and `/implementation`.

It must:

- start from a valid Stage Anchor from `/recommend`;
- use only the selected audited candidate;
- produce an Elementor Structure Panel tree;
- use human-readable `structure_label` values and machine-readable EV4 class names;
- apply the naming convention `[section-role]__[content-group]--[variant]`;
- keep meaningful content editable;
- isolate overlays and decorations in named stages;
- enforce a wrapper budget and justify extra wrappers;
- produce a responsive structure contract without final CSS;
- emit `ev4-build-tree-payload@1.0.0`;
- emit the next Stage Anchor for `/implementation`.

## Debug Trace Contract Notes

The debug trace layer is active as `diagnostics/LLM_DEBUG_TRACE_CONTRACT.md`.

It does not reveal hidden chain-of-thought. It requires each stage, when debug mode is requested, to externalize a compact trace of:

- inputs received and missing;
- decisions made;
- evidence used;
- unknowns propagated;
- rules applied;
- failure symptoms;
- repair route;
- handoff payload schema.

This allows a model-language debugger to find the first broken stage and propose a minimal repair patch.

## Current Next Step

Harden Stage 8 — /implementation, including allowed output formats, scoped CSS boundaries, widget-by-widget implementation contract, asset handling, and implementation debug trace.
