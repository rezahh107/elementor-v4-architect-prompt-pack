## Scaffolded / Draft / Validation Work Remaining

- `/e2e-screenshot-validation` is not run and cannot run without raster screenshot evidence or a screenshot fixture.
- E2E-001 used a realistic textual mockup, not a raster screenshot.
- Pixel-accurate screenshot interpretation remains unvalidated by E2E-001.
- Real Elementor export JSON / EDIS validation remains future work.
- Live Elementor/browser rendering remains future work.

---

## Source-of-Truth Order for Stage 8–10 Alignment

When a stage file contains an older embedded example or stale placeholder, use this precedence:

```text
1. Latest active STATUS.md stage state
2. stages/STAGE_8_10_v1.0.1_HARDENING_ALIGNMENT_PATCH.md
3. The base Stage 8/9/10 contract body
4. Older embedded example placeholders only when not contradicted by 1 or 2
```

This is required because the current patch intentionally preserves the confirmed Stage 8/9/10 contracts while correcting their stale anchor/E2E wording through an active alignment layer.

---

## Stage 8–10 Alignment Patch Result

```yaml
STAGE_8_10_ALIGNMENT_PATCH:
  file: stages/STAGE_8_10_v1.0.1_HARDENING_ALIGNMENT_PATCH.md
  status: confirmed_hardening_patch_v1.0.1
  version: 1.0.1
  applies_to:
    - stages/08_IMPLEMENTATION.md
    - stages/09_FINAL_AUDIT.md
    - stages/10_HANDOFF_EXPORT.md
    - STATUS.md
  fixes:
    - Stage 8 and Stage 9 next-anchor templates must use active STATUS.md status/schema values, not stale scaffolded placeholders.
    - Stage 9 and Stage 10 must use scoped E2E validation vocabulary.
    - Stage 10 must not hard-code e2e_run_available false when E2E-001 evidence exists.
  confirmed_stage_state:
    /implementation: confirmed_hardened_v1.0.0
    /final-audit: confirmed_hardened_v1.0.0
    /handoff-export: confirmed_hardened_v1.0.0
```

Strict boundary:

```text
E2E-001 may support prompt-pack full-pipeline contract validation with minor textual-fixture limitation.
E2E-001 must not be used to claim pixel-accurate screenshot interpretation, live Elementor rendering, or real Elementor export JSON validation.
```

---

## E2E Validation State

```yaml
e2e_validation_state:
  prompt_pack_full_pipeline:
    status: pass_with_minor_flags
    evidence_ref: experiments/E2E-001-test-report.md
    limitation: realistic textual mockup, not raster screenshot
  pixel_accurate_screenshot_interpretation:
    status: not_validated
    required_next_stage: /e2e-screenshot-validation
  live_elementor_rendering:
    status: not_validated
  real_elementor_export_json_or_EDIS:
    status: not_validated
```

Release boundary interpretation:

```text
The previous release blocker requiring one passing E2E run is removed for the prompt-pack full-pipeline contract because E2E-001 reached /handoff-export, preserved anchors/payloads/unknowns/flags, and left no blocker/high finding.

This does not claim pixel-accurate screenshot interpretation, live Elementor rendering, or real export JSON validation. Those remain future validation tracks.

Strict boundary:

```text
TUYA may guide vocabulary, thinking order, normal-flow discipline, relative visual stage logic, responsive caution, design-system mindset, and DOM/audit checklisting.
TUYA must not prove platform capability, infer screenshot content, raise scores, break recommendation ties, invent exact settings, override official docs/export evidence, soften final-audit findings, or clean up handoff risks.

Strict boundary:

```text
RAG may ground platform capability claims.
RAG must not infer screenshot content, select architecture, improve scores, break ties, soften final-audit defects, or clean up handoff risks.

Current stage-source correction:

Strict boundary:

```text
/research may prove or disprove platform capability.
/research must not decide what the current screenshot visually contains.
/research must not score, recommend, build, implement, or audit the section.

```

## Stage Anchor v1.1 Notes

A Stage Anchor is required before starting each stage after `/intake`.

Required v1.1 fields include:

- `target_stage_hardening_status`
- `confidence_delta`
- `partial_rerun_state`

The anchor is an external structured handoff, not hidden reasoning.

---

## Partial Rerun Notes

If only one input changes, the assistant must not automatically rerun the full pipeline.

It must first produce a `PARTIAL RERUN PLAN` that identifies:

- changed input;
- earliest safe rerun stage;
- reusable stages;
- invalidated downstream stages;
- required payloads;
- required confirmation if the rerun depends on a missing decision.

---

## E2E Test Notes

E2E-001 passed with minor flags.

Validated:

- full stage sequence through `/handoff-export`;
- Stage Source Access Matrix discipline;
- Stage Anchor v1.1 continuity;
- Debug Trace compatibility;
- unknown propagation;
- Stage 4 arithmetic / N/A / unknown handling;
- Stage 5 audit behavior;
- Stage 6 recommendation gate;
- Stage 7 editability and tree readability;
- Stage 8 exact-value restraint and scoped CSS map;
- Stage 9 blocker/high behavior;
- Stage 10 audit-flag preservation.

Not validated by E2E-001:

- pixel-accurate raster screenshot interpretation;
- live Elementor rendering;
- real Elementor export JSON;
- browser/device QA.

---

## Current Next Step

Preferred next action:

```text
Prepare or run /e2e-screenshot-validation when raster screenshot evidence or a screenshot fixture is available.
```

Do not remove the E2E-001 medium flag until screenshot-based validation produces a verifiable report.
