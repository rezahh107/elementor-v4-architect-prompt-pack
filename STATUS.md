## Stage 5 v1.2 Notes

Stage 5 now has these additional constraints before Stage 6:

- It must audit its own audit report for hidden recommendation leakage.
- It must keep candidate reporting neutral and avoid implied preference.
- It must emit a tie handoff payload instead of breaking ties.
- It must bind responsive inheritance audits to the authoritative Stage 4/rubric rule.
- It must emit `ev4-score-audit-payload@1.2.0` when the v1.2 patch is active.

## Current Next Step

Define Stage 6 — /recommend.
